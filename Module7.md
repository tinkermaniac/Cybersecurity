# Module 7: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

<a id="module71"></a>
### 7.1 Introduction to SIEM

#### Log Management

SIEM systems centralize log data from various sources, facilitating analysis and monitoring.

*Components of Log Management:*
1. **Log Collection:** Gather logs from servers, network devices, and applications.
2. **Log Storage:** Store logs securely with access controls and encryption.
3. **Log Retrieval:** Quickly retrieve and search logs for analysis.

*Example SIEM Log Query:*
- Searching for failed login attempts across multiple servers.

```sql
source="*firewall*" AND event_type="failed_login"
```
#### Correlation and Analysis

SIEM systems correlate and analyze log data to identify patterns and potential security incidents.

*Correlation Techniques* :
1. **Temporal Correlation:** Analyze events over time.
2. **Statistical Correlation:** Identify deviations from normal patterns.
3. **Aggregation:** Summarize data for analysis.

*Example SIEM Correlation Rule* :
- Correlating multiple login failures within a short timeframe.

```sql
source="*auth_logs*" AND event_type="failed_login"
| stats count by user
| where count > 3
```

### 7.2 Log Analysis and Incident ResponseIdentifying Anomalies and Patterns

SIEM platforms use machine learning and statistical analysis to identify abnormal behavior.

*Behavioral Analysis:*
- Analyzing user login patterns to detect unusual login times or locations.

*Example SIEM Query for Anomaly Detection:*
- Identifying a sudden spike in network traffic.

```sql
source="*network_logs*" | timechart span=1h count
```
Incident Handling and Reporting

SIEM systems facilitate effective incident response by providing real-time alerts and detailed reporting.

#### Incident Handling Process:

1. Detection: Identify and confirm the incident.
2. Containment: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
3. Eradication: Remove the threat and restore affected systems.
4. Recovery: Restore normal operations.
5. Lessons Learned: Analyze the incident for improvements.

#### SIEM Reporting:
- Generate reports on incidents, compliance, and security posture.
