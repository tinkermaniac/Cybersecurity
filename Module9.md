# Module 9: Penetration Testing

<a id="module91"></a>
### 9.1 Introduction to Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity, simulating real-world cyber attacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems.

#### Types of Penetration Testing

1. **Black Box Testing:**
   - **Description:** Simulates an external cyber attack without any prior knowledge of the target system.
   - **Methodology:** 
     - Conducts external reconnaissance.
     - Identifies vulnerabilities and exploits them.

2. **White Box Testing:**
   - **Description:** Tester has complete knowledge of the target system, similar to an insider.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Conducts in-depth analysis of the system's architecture.
     - Identifies and exploits vulnerabilities.

3. **Grey Box Testing:**
   - **Description:** Tester has partial knowledge of the target system.
   - **Methodology:**
     - Simulates an attack with limited information.
     - Evaluates the effectiveness of existing security measures.

#### Rules of Engagement

Establishing clear rules of engagement is vital for conducting effective penetration tests.

**Key Aspects:**

- **Scope Definition:**
  - Clearly define the systems and networks included in the test.
- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:**
  - Adhere to applicable laws and ethical standards.
- **Communication:**
  - Maintain transparent communication with stakeholders.
- **Testing Windows:**
  - Define the timeframe for testing to minimize disruption.

### 9.2 Penetration Testing Methodologies

#### Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the initial phase of penetration testing, gathering information about the target system.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Passive Reconnaissance:**
   - Collect information without directly interacting with the target.
   - **Example Tools:**
     - WHOIS, Google Dorks.

2. **Active Reconnaissance:**
   - Interact directly with the target to gather information.
   - **Example Tools:**
     - Nmap, Recon-ng.

#### Scanning

Scanning involves identifying live hosts, open ports, and services on the target network.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Host Discovery:**
   - Identify live hosts using various techniques.
   - **Example Nmap Command:**
     ```
     nmap -sn target_ip_range
     ```

2. **Port Scanning:**
   - Identify open ports and services on live hosts.
   - **Example Nmap Command:**
     ```
     nmap -sS -p 1-1000 target_ip
     ```

#### Exploitation

Exploitation is the process of leveraging identified vulnerabilities to compromise the target system.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Vulnerability Exploitation:**
   - Identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
   - **Example Metasploit Command:**
     ```
     msfconsole
     ```

2. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - Maintain access and escalate privileges.
   - **Example Linux Privilege Escalation:**
     ```
     sudo -l
     ```

#### Reporting and Documentation

A comprehensive report is crucial to communicate findings and recommendations.

**Key Components:**

1. **Executive Summary:**
   - Summarize key findings for non-technical stakeholders.
2. **Technical Details:**
   - Provide in-depth technical analysis of vulnerabilities.
3. **Recommendations:**
   - Offer actionable suggestions for remediation.
4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Evaluate the severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities.
