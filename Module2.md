### 2.1 Networking Basics

#### OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model serves as a conceptual framework to understand network interactions. It comprises seven layers, each playing a distinct role in data communication.

*Layer Breakdown:*
1. **Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables and hardware.
2. **Data Link Layer:** Ensures reliable data transfer over a physical link, using MAC addresses for device identification.
3. **Network Layer:** Manages routing and addressing, determining the optimal path for data packets.
4. **Transport Layer:** Ensures end-to-end communication, handling data segmentation and reassembly.
5. **Session Layer:** Manages sessions or connections between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Translates data between the application layer and lower layers, handling encryption and compression.
7. **Application Layer:** Facilitates communication between software applications.

#### TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the fundamental suite of protocols that powers the internet.

*Key Protocols:*
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Provides faster, connectionless communication but with no error-checking.
- **IP (Internet Protocol):** Handles the addressing and routing of data packets.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Manages error messages and network diagnostics.

### 2.2 Network Security Principles

#### Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Firewalls act as the first line of defense, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) identify and respond to potential security threats.

*Types of Firewalls:*
1. **Packet Filtering Firewalls:** Inspects data packets and allows or denies them based on defined rules.
2. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls:** Examines the context of active connections to make intelligent decisions.
3. **Proxy Firewalls:** Acts as an intermediary between internal and external networks, enhancing security.

*Intrusion Detection Techniques:*
- **Signature-Based Detection:** Matches patterns of known threats.
- **Anomaly-Based Detection:** Identifies deviations from normal network behavior.
- **Heuristic-Based Detection:** Utilizes rules to detect previously unseen threats.

#### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Secure Network Design

VPNs create secure, encrypted connections over public networks, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.

*VPN Types:*
- **Site-to-Site VPN:** Connects entire networks over the internet securely.
- **Remote Access VPN:** Allows individual users to connect securely to a private network.

*Secure Network Design Principles:*
1. **Least Privilege:** Restrict access to only what is necessary.
2. **Defense in Depth:** Layered security to protect against multiple threats.
3. **Access Controls:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### 2.3 Wireless Network Security

#### WPA3 and Wireless Security Best Practices

Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) is the latest standard for securing Wi-Fi networks, providing stronger encryption and authentication.

*WPA3 Features:*
- **Individualized Data Encryption:** Each device has its own encryption key.
- **Protection Against Brute-Force Attacks:** Resistant to offline dictionary attacks.

*Wireless Security Best Practices:*
1. **Use Strong Encryption:** Employ WPA3 or WPA2 with strong, unique passwords.
2. **Regularly Update Firmware:** Keep routers and access points updated to patch vulnerabilities.
3. **Disable Unused Services:** Turn off unnecessary features to reduce attack surfaces.
