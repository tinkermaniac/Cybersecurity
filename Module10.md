# Module 10: Ethical Hacking

<a id="module101"></a>
### 10.1 Fundamentals of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to identify vulnerabilities in a system, similar to those exploited by malicious hackers.

#### White Hat vs. Black Hat Hacking

1. **White Hat Hacking:**
   - **Description:** Ethical hackers, also known as "white hats," use their skills to strengthen security by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities.
   - **Role:**
     - Conduct authorized penetration tests.
     - Work towards enhancing cybersecurity defenses.

2. **Black Hat Hacking:**
   - **Description:** Malicious hackers, or "black hats," exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain, often engaging in illegal activities.
   - **Role:**
     - Exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes.
     - Engage in unauthorized and illegal activities.

#### Legal and Ethical Considerations

Ethical hacking must adhere to legal and ethical standards to ensure responsible and authorized testing.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Authorized Access:**
  - Only perform hacking activities on systems with explicit permission.
- **Responsible Disclosure:**
  - Report vulnerabilities to the system owner responsibly.
- **Adherence to Laws:**
  - Comply with local and international laws related to cybersecurity.

### 10.2 Metasploit Framework

Metasploit is a powerful open-source penetration testing framework used for developing, testing, and executing exploit code.

#### Introduction to Metasploit

1. **Overview:**
   - Metasploit provides a comprehensive platform for penetration testing, allowing testers to automate the process of exploiting vulnerabilities.

2. **Architecture:**
   - Metasploit follows a modular architecture with various components for exploit development, payload generation, and post-exploitation.

#### Exploitation Techniques and Post-Exploitation

Ethical hackers use Metasploit to simulate real-world attacks, understand exploitation techniques, and perform post-exploitation activities.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Exploitation:**
   - Metasploit includes a vast database of exploits for various vulnerabilities.
   - **Example Exploit Command:**
     ```
     use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
     ```

2. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - After successful exploitation, ethical hackers perform post-exploitation tasks.
   - **Example Meterpreter Command:**
     ```
     background
     use post/windows/manage/migrate
     ```
