# Module 14: Incident Response and Forensics

<a id="module141"></a>
### 14.1 Incident Response Planning

Incident response is a critical component of cybersecurity, ensuring organizations are prepared to handle and mitigate security incidents effectively.

#### Creating an Incident Response Plan

1. **Define Incident Types:**
   - Categorize potential security incidents based on severity and impact.
   - Example Framework:
     ```
     # Define incident types - malware infections, unauthorized access, etc.
     ```

2. **Incident Response Team Formation:**
   - Establish a dedicated incident response team with defined roles and responsibilities.
   - Example Guidelines:
     ```
     # Assign roles - Incident Commander, Forensic Analyst, Communication Coordinator, etc.
     ```

3. **Communication Protocols:**
   - Develop communication plans for internal and external stakeholders.
   - Example Protocol:
     ```
     # Establish communication channels and reporting procedures.
     ```

#### Cybersecurity Incident Lifecycle

Understanding the incident lifecycle is crucial for responding promptly and effectively.

1. **Detection:**
   - Employ monitoring tools and techniques to detect incidents.
   - Example Techniques:
     ```
     # Implement intrusion detection systems and anomaly detection.
     ```

2. **Analysis and Triage:**
   - Investigate and triage incidents to determine severity.
   - Example Triage Steps:
     ```
     # Analyze logs, assess impact, and categorize incidents.
     ```

3. **Containment:**
   - Implement containment measures to prevent further damage.
   - Example Containment Actions:
     ```
     # Isolate affected systems, disable compromised accounts, etc.
     ```

### 14.2 Digital Forensics

Digital forensics involves the collection and analysis of electronic evidence to investigate and respond to security incidents.

#### Data Acquisition and Preservation

1. **Forensic Imaging:**
   - Create forensic images of storage devices for analysis.
   - Example Command:
     ```
     dd if=/dev/sda of=forensic_image.dd bs=1M
     ```

2. **Chain of Custody:**
   - Maintain a documented chain of custody for collected evidence.
   - Example Documentation:
     ```
     # Record who handled the evidence, when, and for what purpose.
     ```

#### Forensic Analysis Tools

1. **Autopsy:**
   - Open-source digital forensics platform for in-depth analysis.
   - Example Usage:
     ```
     autopsy <forensic_image.dd>
     ```

2. **Sleuth Kit:**
   - Collection of command-line tools for forensic analysis.
   - Example Command:
     ```
     fls -r <forensic_image.dd>
     ```
