<a id="module61"></a>
### 6.1 Types of Malware

#### Viruses

Viruses are malicious programs that infect legitimate files and spread when those files are executed.

*Characteristics:*
- Requires a host file to infect.
- Can modify or delete files.
- Often spread through email attachments or infected software.

#### Worms

Worms are standalone programs that replicate and spread across networks without needing a host file.

*Characteristics:*
- Self-replicating and self-propagating.
- Can exploit vulnerabilities to spread rapidly.
- Often spread through network connections.

#### Trojans

Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software but contain malicious code.

*Characteristics:*
- Do not replicate independently.
- Require user interaction to execute.
- Commonly distributed via email attachments or malicious websites.

#### Ransomware

Ransomware encrypts files or entire systems, demanding payment for their release.

*Characteristics:*
- Encrypts files with strong encryption algorithms.
- Displays ransom messages demanding payment in cryptocurrency.
- Spread through malicious email attachments or compromised websites.

#### Spyware and Adware

Spyware gathers information about a user's activities without their knowledge, while adware displays unwanted advertisements.

#### Pretexting and Baiting

Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to trick individuals into divulging information. Baiting involves enticing victims with something desirable.

*Example:*
- A pretexting call claiming to be from IT support, requesting login credentials.

*Prevention:*
- Verify requests for sensitive information through trusted channels.
